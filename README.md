# PRISMS Plasticity Modifications & DSP Code Thesis Chris Nieuwenhuis

This repository contains modifications to the PRISMS Plasticity code to run the Discrete Slip Plane (DSP) model. The changes are reflected in the updated code files under the directory 'PRISMS Plasticity Update Code'. The PRISMS Plasticity code runs on the rate dependent formulation of the crystal plasticity model. After uploading the files, the PRISMS Plasticity code should be recompiled.

In addition, the repository includes a standalone Python script implementing the Discrete Slip Plane (DSP) model in the file 'dspcodeappendix'.

## Notes
These changes are part of my work in exploring plastic deformation models. Feel free to explore or reach out with questions. Questions may be mailed to oswald310@hotmail.com. Done under supervision of Prof. Francesco Maresca (f.maresca@rug.nl).
